# Simple implementation of a crosswords puzzle solver in Python

## Run the solver

Simply run

```bash
> python main.py
```

You can change the source file for the crosswords directly in `main.py`

## Constraint Programming

`constraint_programming.py` was entirely developped by C. Dürr at Ecole Centrale Supélec.
